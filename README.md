# This repo contains (or will contain) multiple JavaProjects
1. Email application:
    Users will be assigned a email address of the company based on their names and department. I will randomly assign them a password, but they will be able to set their new password.
2. Student Database application:
    Users will be able to enter students info and the system will create id for them. Students can enroll in multiple classes and pay their tuitions and check their tuition balances.
